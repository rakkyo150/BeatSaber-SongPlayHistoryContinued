## Features

- Create a personal play database
- Display scores and total play counts
- _(Planned)_ Integrate into the leaderboard system 

## Notes

- The play count also counts failed plays.
- It's unable to see your previous records (that you achieved before installing this mod) as they are just lost.
- The data file is located in Beat Saber's _UserData_ directory. The file contains some more details about your plays. You can also delete individual records if you want.
- The data are not uploaded anywhere so you have to **backup** the file when re-installing the game.
- If you run into any problem, please contact me either via Discord _(peperoro#1013)_ or by filing an issue.
