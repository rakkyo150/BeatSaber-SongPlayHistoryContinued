## Notes

- Recording play data begins when you first install this plugin.
- The data file is located in Beat Saber's _UserData_ directory. You can delete individual records from there if you want.
- The data are not uploaded anywhere so you have to **backup** the file when re-installing the game.
- If you run into any problem, please contact me either via Discord _(peperoro#1013)_ or by filing an issue.
