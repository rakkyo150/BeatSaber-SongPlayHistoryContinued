## Features

- Create a personal play database
- Display scores and total play counts
- _(Planned)_ Integrate into the leaderboard system 

## Notes

- The play count also counts failed plays.
- It's unable to see your previous records (that you achieved before installing this plugin) as they are not stored anywhere.
- No more than 9 scores will be shown at once due to space limit.
- The data file is located in Beat Saber's _UserData_ directory. The file contains some more details about your plays.
- This plugin is still under tests. If you find any problem with this plugin, please report to _peperoro#1013 (Discord)_ for future improvement.
