Compare your own scores.

## Screenshots

## Features

- Record play results to a file
- Display scores and total play counts

## Notes

- You will not be able to see your previous records (that you made before installing the plugin) since they cannot be retrieved from anywhere.
- The data file is located in Beat Saber's _UserData_ directory.
- I haven't fully tested the plugin against various situations. If the file grows too large or makes any problem or delay, please report to _peperoro#1013 (Discord)_ for future improvement.
